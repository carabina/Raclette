## Quick Start

Raclette makes it easy for you to mutate your `UITableView` in a few seconds. 

**Example**

``` swift
tableView.createSection { section in 
	section.headerTitle = "Section Header"
    section.footerTitle = "Section Footer"
    section.createRow { row in
      	row.configuration = { cell in
          	cell.textLabel?.text = "Hello World!"
      	}
    }
}
```



## Features

* Integrates easily as an extension for your existing `UITableView`
* Support for dynamic cell height
* Support for inline closures to reduce code
* Use your own cells inheriting from `UITableViewCell`
* Reusing cells by it's identifier is magically managed for you âœ¨
* Redirection for `UIScrollViewDelegate`
